# Anywhere But Here

In a team of four we made use of MapQuests multiple APIs and the Leaflet library to build this app in React making use of useState and useEffect. In this app users can define a starting location or click a button to add their street address based on geolocation. Next they will add a search query. Upon submitting a list of points of interest will appear, along with an interactive map with pins for each location. User can select a destination from the returned list and will then be provided with directions.
